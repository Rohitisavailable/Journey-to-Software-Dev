is_empty = True 
#is_empty is a boolean variable that indicates whether a container is empty or not.
# It is set to True, meaning the container is currently empty.
#boolean variables can be used to represent two states: True or False.
# For example, it can be used to check if a list, string, or other data structure has no elements.
#Boolean variables should be used using capital letters (True or False) in Python.
# This is a common practice in programming to use boolean variables for conditions and checks.

#value of True or False is determined by the context in which it is used.
#value of True is 1

is_hidden = False
#is_hidden is a boolean variable that indicates whether something is hidden or not.
# It is set to False, meaning the item is currently visible or not hidden.
#boolean variables can be used to represent two states: True or False.
# For example, it can be used to check if a user interface element is visible or not.

#value of False is 0

print(42 * is_hidden)

print(42 * False)

#in order to print the value of 0 we can use either False or is_hidden.
#here, we are multiplying 42 by is_hidden which is False (0).
# The result will be 0 because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.

print(50 * is_empty)

print(50 * True)
#in order to print the value of 1 we can use either True or is_empty.
#here, we are multiplying 50 by is_empty which is True (1).
# The result will be 50 because any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself.
